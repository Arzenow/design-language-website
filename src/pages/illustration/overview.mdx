## Principles

IBM has a distinct perspective on illustration and a carefully crafted set of principles and best practices. Our illustrations aim to be engineered, clear, nimble, diverse, and delightful to create the best possible experience for viewers. These principles capture fundamental ideas that are important to IBM’s point of view for illustrations and their overall effectiveness regardless of size or medium.

### Engineered

</Column>
<Column colLg={8} noGutter>

IBM illustrations should feel engineered with a strong sense of balance and control. Precise use of the grid along with consistent shapes, angles and radii help define a particular aesthetic that is critical in expressing the “IBMness” of our illustrations and reveals a well considered and systematic approach.

<Column colLg={4} noGutter>

### Clear

</Column>
<Column colLg={8} noGutter>

IBM illustration should never work too hard or be burdened with too many ideas. Only essential, non-decorative, elements should be used to communicate the main idea. Keeping an illustration simple and straight-forward adds clarity. This will help guide the viewers through complex concepts, stories or scenarios.

<Column colLg={4} noGutter>

### Nimble

</Column>
<Column colLg={8} noGutter>

IBM illustrations should display a sense of ease, lightness, and nimbleness. This nimble sense of composition, space, weight and orderliness will help the viewer intake complexity with ease. This nimble quality also adds a great sense of activity and liveliness in the illustration.

### Diverse

</Column>
<Column colLg={8} noGutter>

IBM has great pride in our commitment to diversity and inclusion and IBM illustrations should be created in the same spirit. Gender, cultural and geographical diversity should always be considered when creating illustrations so that we strive for inclusion, representation and accessibility for all.

### Delightful

</Column>
<Column colLg={8} noGutter>

IBM illustrations should carry a sense of wonder and delight. While illustration is primarily used to explain or convey meaning, its delivery can be more lighthearted at times. This means adding a sense of fun that isn't overly humorous, but is instead spirited, charming and always situation-appropriate.

## Illustration styles

IBM illustration styles have been carefully considered to allow our design teams to implement with success across IBM while maintain a consistent and unifying aesthetic. They draw from the DNA of visual elements and principles within the IBM Design Language and IBM’s rich visual history.

### Line style

[Line style](https://link) illustrations are simple yet hard working visuals that convey a sense of precision, honesty, and authority. They are a continuation of pictogram logic but extended to allow for communicating richer narratives or concepts.
