## Principles

IBM has a distinct perspective on illustration and a carefully crafted set of principles and best practices. Our illustrations aim to be engineered, clear, nimble, diverse, and delightful to create the best possible experience for viewers. These principles capture fundamental ideas that are important to IBM’s point of view for illustrations and their overall effectiveness regardless of size or medium.

## Illustration styles

IBM illustration styles have been carefully considered to allow our design teams to implement with success across IBM while maintain a consistent and unifying aesthetic. They draw from the DNA of visual elements and principles within the IBM Design Language and IBM’s rich visual history.

### Line style

Line style illustrations are simple yet hard working visuals that convey a sense of precision, honesty, and authority. They are a continuation of pictogram logic but extended to allow for communicating richer narratives or concepts. [Learn more](https://link).
