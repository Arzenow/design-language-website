## Workspace setup

The isometric grid behaves differently than Illustrator grids you may be used to. Here are a few workspace specifications that makes it easier align your artwork properly to the grid.

- Turn on snap to point.
- Turn off snap to grid and snap to pixel.
- Under `(Illustrator > Preferences)`, use the following specifications for Smart Guides:

## Creating perspective

Perspective can be simulated with simple, rectilinear shapes built on the isometric grid. However, more complex objects such as cirlces and 2D content on surfaces can require additional techniques. Here are a couple ways to transform objects to create perspective.

### Automated object transformations

1. Download the [IBM illustration starter kit]()
2. Double click the `Isometric Transformations.aia` file to install the Illustrator Actions.
3. Open the actions palette by navigating to `(Window > Actions)`.
4. Place any 2d object that you want to transform in a square or rectangle. The dimensions of the bounding square or rectangle should be multiples of 8px so that it will snap to the grid once transformed.
5. Select the desired transformation from the actions menu and click Play.

### Manual object transformations

1. Place any 2d object that you want to transform in a square or rectangle. The dimensions of the bounding square or rectangle should be multiples of 8px so that it will snap to the grid once transformed.
2. Perform the transformations `Scale`, `Shear`, and `Rotate` located in the
 `(Object > Transform)` menu. Use the settings in the table below.

| Direction    | Vertical scale | Shear | Rotate |
| ------------ | -------------- | ----- | ------ |
| Left-facing  | 86.6%          | -30°  | -30°   |
| Top-facing   | 86.6%          | 30°   | -30°   |
| Right-facing | 86.6%          | 30°   | 30°    |

### 3D effects

In most cases, we recommend against Illustrator’s 3D effects. This is because the 3D effects can yield unexpected results or objects that do not easily adhere to the grid. However, some objects may require 3D effects such as Revolve and 3D Extrude & Bevel in their construction.

1. Select the 2D object to which you will apply 3D effects.
2. Navigate to `(Effect > 3D)` and choose a 3D effect.
3. In the 3D effect options, choose one of the isometric settings for the `Position` dropdown.
4. In the `Surface` dropdown, choose  No Shading .
5. Expand the object with `(Object > Expand Appearance)` .
6. Apply your own shading using the [IDL color palette](/color).

## Rounded objects and depth

Simulating dimension with rectilinear objects is rather straightforward, but objects with rounded edges can be tricky. Any rounded object, whether it is a rounded rectangle or a circle, can be constructed using cylindars. From there, it is easy to combine cylindars with rectangular prisms to make rounded rectangles with depth.

</Column>
</Row>

### Drawing a cylindar

1. Draw a circle and a square with the same dimensions. The dimensions should be multiples of 8px so that it will snap to the grid once transformed.
2. Draw an “X” over the bounding square.
3. Group the objects and transform them in the desired direction.

   </Column>
   </Row>

4. Copy the transformed object and paste it along the grid in the direction of of the depth.
5. With the Pen Tool, draw a polygon connecting the intersections of the circles and the diagonal lines.

   </Column>
   </Row>

6. Copy the circle on the surface.
7. Select both circles and the polygon and `Add` them together using the `(Window > Pathfinder)` palette.
8. Paste the circle in place with `(Edit > Paste in place)`.
