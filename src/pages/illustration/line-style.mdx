### Mixing line weights

Mixing line wieghts in an illustration is acceptable as long as you don’t use weights that are too similar. It is also recommended not to use more than four weights within a single illustration.

<DoDontRow>
<DoDont caption="Line weights that are clearly different work very well together. This successful example combines four weights, 1px, 2px, 4px and 6px.">

<DoDont type="dont" caption="Line weights that are too similar create an unnecessary tension. This example combines three weights, 0.72px, 1px, and 1.5px.">
