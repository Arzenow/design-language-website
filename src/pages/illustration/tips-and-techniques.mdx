Our illustrations take on many forms and ultimately have a job to do. They must always have a clear purpose, support content and guide a user to understand difficult concepts, products or services. Creating clear, simple, and engaging illustrations help make it possible to make meaningful connections with our viewers.

## Ways of seeing

There are many ways of communicating ideas with illustration. Some more literal or abstract or zoomed-in or zoomed-out while others require more fidelity to capture the details. Whatever the best strategy, IBM illustration styles have been developed with this in mind so that you can determine which approach best depicts the concepts or the nature of the subject.

### Abstract and literal

Expressing concepts in abstract ways creates interest and exciting compositions while literal executions can communicate complicated concepts more clearly. Both techniques are vital for communications with illustrations.

<Caption>Abstraction is more conceptual and provocative.</Caption>
</Column>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={6}>

![](./images/tips-and-techniques/literal.png)

<Caption>Literal expressions are more explanatory and utilitarian.</Caption>
</Column>

</Row>

### Micro and macro

IBM has a long and rich history of showing systems in micro and macro scales. This ability to communicate in both scales allows us to communicate the hard to see or the expansive. These views are critical to illustration techniques and effectiveness.

<Column colMd={4} colLg={6}>

<Column colMd={4} colLg={6}>

<Caption>Macro views show a larger picture.</Caption>
</Column>

</Row>

### Low fidelity and high fidelity

Some illustrations benefit from being simple and direct while others require more fidelity to capture more detail or offer dramatic effect. Illumination is always an idea to consider with color and detailing techniques (like gradients) which can help communicate more vividly.

<Column colMd={4} colLg={6}>

![](./images/tips-and-techniques/high-fidelity.png)

<Caption>Gradients and tone add depth and drama.</Caption>
</Column>

</Row>

## Intent

Knowing the intent of your illustration helps create the framework for decision-making. Will it serve as the cover of a brochure, a large wall at an event or support a series of ideas in a webpag? Illustrations can live within a wide variety of sizes and environments whether digital or physical. There are different types of illustrations used for different purposes at different scales and complexities.

### Featured

Featured (or hero) illustrations are impactful, delightful illustrations that tell complex stories. Delightful in nature, hero illustrations lend themselves to be more metaphorical and intricate than other types of imagery utilizing more color, space, and elements. While heros are more complex and imaginative, they should remain focused and balanced. Maintaining a sense of professionalism and organization through thoughtful composition is key.

### Supportive

Supportive (or spot) illustrations are simplified illustrations that usually enhance other content. Because they are supporting elements, spot illustrations must be easily read so viewers grasp concepts at glance. Spot illustrations are focused but maintain a feeling of delight and nimbleness, guiding a viewer through a narrative. Spot illustrations are commonly used in digital empty states, in composition with other spot illustrations, or paired with text.

## Color

Color in illustration sets tone, gives meaning, and reinforces our brand expression. When choosing colors for your illustrations, consider their association with your particular product or communication. When chosen thoughfully, illustrations can achieve engaging and delightful results. 

The starting point for illustrations should always be the [IDL color palette](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/color). Consistent use of this palette creates brand consistency and distinction. 
When working on specific business units within IBM, please reference the individual [brand guidelines](https://www.ibm.com/brand/systems) for more detailed color guidance.

### Color schemes

There are many different ways to combine swatches from the IDL color palette depending on the style and intent of your illustration. Below are a few common approaches to consider.

#### Monochromatic
Monochromatic illustrations have a simple and direct quality to them and are comprised of tints and tones of a single hue. This tehnique has a logical, systematic  engineered look. Within this scheme flat or tint techniques can be applied.

</Column>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>

</Column>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>

![](./images/tips-and-techniques/monochromatic-3.png)

</Column>
</Row>

#### Analogous
Analogous colors bring a harmonious quality by utilizing neighboring hues from the palette. This adds subtle depth, movement, and fidelity to an illustration. Two to three hues work best for this technique. Additional colors will likely add unnecessary complexity and should be avoided.

<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>

</Column>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>

![](./images/tips-and-techniques/analogous-3.png)

</Column>
</Row>

#### Complementary
The opposing nature of complementary colors create vibrancy and tension which can be quite effective when you want to draw attention to an element. Large fields of complementary colors can be quite jarring so it’s best to think in terms of accents that bring just the right amount of contrast and life to an illustration.

</Column>
<Column colMd={4} colLg={4}>

![](./images/tips-and-techniques/complementary-3.png)

</Column>
</Row>

### Use of blue

Be cautious when using blues in an illustration that could potentially compete with other elements that are also blue such as UI buttons and other points of focus.

<DoDontRow>
<DoDont caption="Call to action is delineated.">

![](./images/tips-and-techniques/cta-1.png)

</DoDont>
<DoDont type="dont" caption="Call to action blends into background.">

![](./images/tips-and-techniques/cta-2.png)

</DoDont>
</DoDontRow>

### Additional colors

In some cases, additional colors will be required to achieve a more realistic illustration. In general, orange and yellow tones are reserved for UI alert colors only but may be used if required. The use of additional colors should be limited to specific use cases such as skin tones.

<DoDontRow>
<DoDont caption="Skin tones are blends of IBM red and green swatches to extend the palette.">

</DoDont>
<DoDont type="dont" caption="The pencil can be any other color and thus yellow should be avoided in this case.">

![](./images/tips-and-techniques/add-color-2.png)

</DoDont>
</DoDontRow>

### Accessibility

IBM firmly believes that all of our experiences should be accessible for everyone, regardless of abilities or impairments. If an illustration conveys information not entirely captured in accompanying text, the main concepts must meet [3:1 AA accessibility](https://link) standards. Always be conscious when choosing colors to give every user the same experience, regardless of ability.

<DoDontRow>
<DoDont caption="Colors pass with 3.9:1 contrast ratio.">

![](./images/tips-and-techniques/accessibility-1.png)

</DoDont>
<DoDont type="dont" caption="Colors fail with 2.1:1 contrast ratio.">

![](./images/tips-and-techniques/accessibility-2.png)

</DoDont>
</DoDontRow>

## Canvases

Use common aspect ratios, such as 16:9, 4:3, 3:2, 2:1, and 1:1 for illustrations unless otherwise dictated by specific platform requirements. These helpful aspect ratios also correspond well to the resolution, scale and line weights. This set of common aspect ratios play a larger role across IBM’s Design Language from our components, formats, signage, and event spaces.

## Composition

IBM has very specific guidance around compotition. The following tips show how to best compose your ideas into distinct and successful illustrations. Visit [IDL Layout guidance](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/layout/overview) afor more information about compostion.

### Framing

The [2x Grid](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/2x-grid) can be a useful guide when thinking about composing illustrations. Images should leverage divisions of two. Either horizontal or vertical, these divisions create zones for different kinds of representation. For example one area could show a literal object while the adjacent area could reveal what is happening digitally or behind the scenes.

### Focal points

Use the [2x Grid](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/2x-grid) to establish clear focal points. It may seem prescriptive, but when seen together this approach acts as connective tissue between IBM illustrations. The same approach is used to create delightful animated experiences.
