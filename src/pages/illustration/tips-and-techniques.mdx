Our illustrations take on many forms and ultimately have a job to do. They must always have a clear purpose, support content and guide a user to understand difficult concepts, products or services. Creating clear, simple, and engaging illustrations help make it possible to make meaningful connections with our viewers.

## Ways of seeing

There are many ways of communicating ideas with illustration. Some more literal or abstract or zoomed-in or zoomed-out while others require more fidelity to capture the details. Whatever the best strategy, IBM illustration styles have been developed with this in mind so that you can determine which approach best depicts the concepts or the nature of the subject.

### Abstract and literal

Expressing concepts in abstract ways creates interest and exciting compositions while literal executions can communicate complicated concepts more clearly. Both techniques are vital for communications with illustrations.

### Micro and macro

IBM has a long and rich history of showing systems in micro and macro scales. This ability to communicate in both scales allows us to communicate the hard to see or the expansive. These views are critical to illustration techniques and effectiveness.

### Low fidelity and high fidelity

Some illustrations benefit from being simple and direct while others require more fidelity to capture more detail or offer dramatic effect. Illumination is always an idea to consider with color and detailing techniques (like gradients) which can help communicate more vividly.

## Composition

Image composition is the intentional arrangement of individual subjects within a scene to form the final image. There are two key aspects to composition that you should consider for every image.

### Framing

The 2x Grid can be a useful guide when thinking about composing imagery and positioning subjects. Images should leverage divisions of two. Either horizontal or vertical, these divisions create zones for subjects, allowing for carefully considered compositions that feel kinetic, like moments in time.

### Focal points

Use the 2x Grid to establish clear focal points. It may seem prescriptive, but when seen together this approach acts as connective tissue between IBM images. The same approach is used to create delightful film experiences.

## Lighting

Whenever possible, use natural light or techniques that simulate natural light. IBM imagery is allergic to artificiality. The sincere portrayal of subject is paramount. We cannot manufacture a better reality than reality itself.

## Depth-of-field

Everything should be in sharp focus. This crisp approach reinforces a deep interest in everything, and an emphasis on context and detail. Everything is presented evenly.

## Effects and filters

Avoid anything artificial. We’re a fact-based company. We communicate with clarity, and our photography should communicate this too. We avoid hyperbole and jargon. Our imagery should avoid spin and overstyling as well.

## Clichés, metaphors & see-say

When it comes to photography, people respond to what they don’t see as much as what they do see. Too often, imagery is used to double-down on what is already understood versus adding depth and dimension. We should use imagery purposefully, to expand ideas and elicit emotion.

We are a fact-based, insightful, opinionated organization. Therefore, we try to avoid abstraction in favor of palatability and tangibility. If an image looks like it could have been created by any other organization, it’s probably lacking a distinct point-of-view (style or subject) or purposeful use that is uniquely IBM.
