To be effective, they need to stand out, be distinctive, be clear and deliver meaning while representing values and numbers accurately.

## Understandable

An IBM data visualization should communicate a message at a glance, in a clear, concise and easy to understand way. Avoid elements that make a visualization appear complex, distant or disjointed. You can achieve this effect using established typographic and visual communication principles that enhance form, readability and meaning. You should remove anything gratuitous and avoid ambiguity or unnecessary embellishments that distract the user from the main concept. Less is more.

## Essential

Design is an exercise in decision-making. When you design data visualization, you must consider the utility in answering a question or solving a problem. A deﬁnite structure, contrast, rhythm and hierarchy of the information displayed is essential to guide users through complex information. Choose the visual model that best leverages the message.
