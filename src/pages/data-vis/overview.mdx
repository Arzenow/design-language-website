## Understandable

An IBM data visualization should communicate a message at a glance, in a clear, concise and easy to understand way. Avoid elements that make a visualization appear complex, distant or disjointed. You can achieve this effect using established typographic and visual communication principles that enhance form, readability and meaning. You should remove anything gratuitous and avoid ambiguity or unnecessary embellishments that distract the user from the main concept. Less is more.

## Essential

<Row>
<Column colMd={5} colLg={8}>

Design is an exercise in decision-making. When you design data visualization, you must consider the utility in answering a question or solving a problem. A deﬁnite structure, contrast, rhythm and hierarchy of the information displayed is essential to guide users through complex information. Choose the visual model that best leverages the message. Take a dive into our Charts section to get a better understanding of how to pair your data with the most effective chart type.

## Impactful

As IBMers, we love celebrating the beauty and creativity of things, but we also invest in showing how things work, conveying concepts and displaying details. Our data visualization should always enable the user to reach the goal and explore the topic in detail by using a clear system of ﬁlters, functions and well-known interaction patterns that make the affordance unmistakable. We embrace a love for details and multiple layers of information as part of a good design practice.

## Consistent

<Row>
<Column colMd={5} colLg={8}>

Just as the core values of IBM have remained consistent over the years, similarly, we want our visualizations to be consistent both stylistically and from a data point of view. Be a good storyteller. Ensure each visual representation corresponds to the relative numerical quantity, and pay attention to proportions and scale of the elements to keep the integrity of the data. A misrepresentation of data could lead to a misinterpretation of reality.

## Contextual

<Row>
<Column colMd={5} colLg={8}>

Successful systems require both ﬁxed and fluid elements of expression. The innovative ways in which we use these elements deliver distinction and uniqueness, but the context should be the primary driver of our decisions. A visualization should be crafted based on the environment of the audience and its constraints. If it’s for marketing or analysis purposes, what’s the level of familiarity with the subject matter, and does the ﬁnal result respect the time required by the audience being asked to experience it? These examples are just a few of the essential aspects in a data visualization that affect layout and style, the level of complexity, and the amount of detail revealed.
