## Mini unit

The basic unit of 2x Grid geometry is the 8-pixel square Mini Unit. Multiples of mini units compose the dimensions of columns, rows, boxes, and their margins and padding. The mini unit adapts to your content while maintaining a consistent visual rhythm.

At breakpoint boundaries, mini units divide the screen into a fixed master grid, and multiples of mini units map to fluid grid column widths and row heights. Fixed boxes are sized in mini units, as are the fixed dimension of hybrid boxes.

Margin and padding are always applied in fixed mini unit multiples. Boxes are sized by applying a sizing scale based on either fixed mini units or fluid column widths, along with a core set of aspect ratios.

## 2x Grid Fundamentals

The core concept of the 2x Grid is to divide or multiply by two, forming a visual rhythm. Fluid grids are built by division, whereas fixed grids are built with multiplication. On breakpoint boundaries, the sizes match. Margins and padding are applied consistently in both cases.

### Columns and rows

Columns and rows create key lines that are essential for visual rhythm, especially for typography. Construct columns by dividing a space into a fluid grid, or by tiling fixed boxes in multiples.

#### Fluid grid

A fluid grid divides space by two. This division is immediately evident in the 2x column structure. Within a breakpoint, column count is constant and unit size scales with screen size. Choose a column count by starting with one, then divide by two as needed:

#### Fixed grid

A fixed grid starts with a fixed unit size from the sizing scale, then tiles and wraps as needed, like text. To employ the 2x concept, multiply box sizes by two and mix them together.

When tiling fixed boxes, the column count is not known in advance, but a grid emerges visually due to the use of a consistent sizing scale. On breakpoint boundaries, fixed sizing scales match column sizes.

#### Hybrid grid

Hybrid grids are also frequent in practice, and hybrid boxes have properties of both.

#### Decision tree

For dense content, use mini units for further alignment and spatial guidance.

### Margins

The margins at the outer edge of the grid are always a fixed size within a breakpoint, even when columns are fluid. See [Breakpoints](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/elements/2x-grid-ui#breakpoints) for a table of margin sizes.

### Padding

Padding is always a fixed multiple of mini units: 16 pixels at all standard breakpoints. Always align type to the edge of box padding. Note, some design tools add padding to text boxes by default; check text box padding and remove it if necessary.

### Gutters

Grid gutters can be absent as shown above, or present as shown below. Th margin around each grid box matches its padding, for a total gutter of 32 pixels. For closely related content, consider a gutterless grid. Apply gutters when content warrants more separation.

### Breakpoints

Use this set of standard breakpoints to maintain layout integrity across screen sizes. For best results, test designs and code at each of these standard breakpoints.

Create Custom Breakpoints to accommodate special needs, by writing your own media queries and CSS rules. Refer to the grid code package for more information.

## Grid behaviors

In user interfaces, screen size is dictated by the device and the user’s chosen window size. We may know content in advance or the content may be dynamic. Carefully consider the user’s goal for their screen space, particularly when displaying dynamic content. Choose the layout approach that best meets the user’s expectation in each case.

For example, when the user resizes their browser, is their goal to: **See more things?** Then scale column count by tiling fixed boxes. **See more content within each thing?** Then scale boxes and use fixed column counts.
