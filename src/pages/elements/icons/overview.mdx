<PageDescription>

  IBM’s icons are visual symbols used to represent ideas, objects, or actions.
  They can communicate messages at a glance, afford interactivity, and draw
  attention to important information. They draw from details found in the Plex
  typeface and work well at small sizes.

## The foundation

The square grid is the underlying fabric of all IBM icons and is used as the foundation to determine line thickness, proportion, shape and positioning across the entire set of icons. The grid helps guide design decisions, which will ensure a unified approach but more importantly allows flexibility in creating the appropriate shape needed to communicate the right idea.

### Base grid

IBM icons are drawn on a pixel based grid of 32px x 32px and scaled down linearly to different sizes. Use the the grid as your basic guideline to snap the artwork in place. We recommend making fine tuned adjustments during your process to support the best shape and details for the shape you’re trying to achieve.

### Padding

The grid contains 2px padding. This ensures icons will retain their desired scale and white space surrounding them when exported. Only extend artwork into the padding for additional visual weight or for specific details required to define the shapes content, meaning or character.

### Keyshapes

Key lines give you consistent sizes for basic shapes or proportions across the icon set. This makes it easier to create a visually stable foundation and helps to establish relationships between the similarly proportioned icons and the objects or ideas they represent.

## Style

The stylistic conventions of IBM icons deliver a meaningful bond with our typeface IBM Plex™. Each icon is intentionally designed to harmoniously pair by sharing distinct details and characteristics found in the letterforms. The video below demonstrates some of these relationships between icons and letter which allows them to family well together visually.

## Strokes

One icon should not look heavier or lighter than other icons of the same size. Nor should there be different weights within one icon. Maintain the same visual weight by using a 2px stroke for all icons. There are a few exceptions to this rule and occur when the icons is complex or has a certain density of line (see below).

## Perspective

The IBM Icons are designed and ready to use but if creating a icon to contribute back into the library please be sure to avoid dimensional representations and use more objective vantage points that are straight-on or profile views.

## Corners

Use a consistent corner radius of 2px for round shapes. The 2px radius can be increased by a multiple of two when necessary to make the icon’s metaphor understandable or object shape clearly defined.

Use an additional radius to make the metaphor reflect the real form of the object.

## Angles

Use 45° angles for even anti-aliasing or increments of 15° whenever possible for other angles needed to best depict the shape you’re creating for your metaphor. You can create harmony across the icon set by consistently making angle sit on the same increments.

## Usage

Iconography is highly functional in a user interface—when used wisely they become an elegant yet efficient way to communicate and help guide a user through an experience. To maintain this functionality it’s important to reduce cognitive load on users by employing icons sparingly and strategically throughout your designs.

### Sizing

Icons have been designed to work best in four sizes: 16px, 20px, 24px, and 32px. Please use icons at their original size produced which are also provided in SVG and Adobe Illustrator files.

### Alignment

Icons are optically aligned to the center of the icon grid within the boundary box. Centering ensures all icons will be aligned correctly when exported and used side by side in a line or a row.

Visually center an icon where the visual weight is heaviest. In some situations, mechanically centering doesn’t work.

### Clearance

When designing icons for touch surfaces, all targets need to be 44px or greater. The icon can be smaller than 44px if padding is added to the touch target with CSS to meet the 44px minimum.

### Color

Icons are always a solid, monochromatic color and need to pass the same color contrast ratio as typography (4.5:1). The color of the icon should reflect the importance of the icon’s action which should always be to help guide a user. For more information on color, see Color in UI.
