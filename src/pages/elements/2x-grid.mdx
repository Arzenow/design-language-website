<PageDescription>

The IBM grid is the framework for all the visual elements and typography. It’s
fundamental to everything we design. No matter what device or medium you’re
working with, the grid gives you just enough structure and guidance so you can
focus on your creative idea.

## Divisions of two

At the core of the 2x Grid concept is the idea of divisions of two. This can be applied to most surfaces, 3-D objects, and architecture as a means to divide space into a helpful grid system. Dividing your space into 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64 columns gives you the basis of the system with the purpose of helping you make decisions and organize your content.

## Constructing the 2x grid

Each application of the grid can require a different grid structure. When constructing the grid, keep in mind these different types of grids and choose which one best serves your need.

### Margins

Add margins to your canvas when you need separation of content from the canvas boundaries. In some cases, margins are specified by the production method.

### Columns and rows

Within the grid, columns and rows are especially important — they give layouts their structure. You can choose between 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 divisions. Stick to your choice throughout your design to maintain structure.

### Gutters

Add gutters to columns and rows when additional space is needed to separate content. When using gutters, always align type to the gutters rather than the canvas divisions. Columns and rows must always remain equal.

## Base unit

If the 2x grid gives your designs structure, base units give them precision. Using a base unit will establish relationships between your grid proportions, typography, dimensions of shapes, and space between elements. You can choose either the mini unit or a baseline unit to build your grid and spatial relationships.

### The mini unit

The mini unit can vary in size depending on the media. When choosing an appropriate unit for your application, consider the viewing distance. Each mini unit in the scale below has a type scale pairing and was determined by legibility over distance.

#### Mini unit for product and web

The 8px mini unit guides everything in both software product and web environments, from the construction of the grid to all the elements that live within it.

### Baseline unit

For advanced typographic layouts, consider creating a base unit from the leading of your document. You can use the leading size or a fraction of it to determine the baseline unit. Although this method requires finer tuning of margins, gutters, and type specs, it can help establish vertical rhythm and typographic harmony throughout your design.

The baseline unit can be used to construct all of the grid proportions, or you can take a hybrid approach by using the mini unit to create your grid and a baseline grid to guide your content.

## Spatial relationships

All spacing between elements can be defined by the base unit. Use the following multiples of your base unit to construct your layout: 1x, 2x, 3x, 4x, 6x, 8x, 10x, 12x. Consistent and replicated use of spacing ensures spatial rhythm between all content.

### Aspect relationships

Use common aspect ratios, such as 16:9, 4:3, 3:2, 2:1, and 1:1 for images and containers. Always measure the width to the columns; the height is determined by it.
