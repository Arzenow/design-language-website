<PageDescription>
  IBMâ€™s pictograms are visual symbols used to represent ideas, objects, or
  narratives. They can communicate messages at a glance, afford interactivity,
  and simplify complex ideas. They draw from details found in the Plex typeface
  and work well in presentations and marketing communications.
