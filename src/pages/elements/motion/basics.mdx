<PageDescription>

Motion is a powerful tool in designing and building communication and user experience. It can bring your work to life, guide users through complex experiences, and help move forward—from here to there, now to next, start to finish—and make progress.

## Style

IBM Design System recognizes different moments in user’s experience, and offers two styles of motion—productive motion, and expressive motion. The motion curves are designed to reflect the philosophical duality of Man and Machine.

The tab component can be used for a variety of content. From text, to images, to columns. If you want to have multiple columns, you'll need to use our `Row` and `Column` helpers as demonstrated in the "Two images" tab.

### Productive

Productive motion creates a sense of efficiency and responsiveness, while being subtle. Use Productive motion for moments when user needs to focus on tasks—micro-interactions such as button interaction and dropdown menus, revealing additional information upon user’s request, or rendering data tables and visualizations.

### Expressive

Expressive motion delivers enthusiastic and vibrant, thus more visible movement. Use expressive motion for significant moments such as user opening a new page or clicking the primary action button, or when the movement itself conveys a meaning or needs to be noticed by the user such as system alert or notification box appearing.

Productivity and Expression are both essential to an interface. Reserve Expressive motion for occasional, important moments to better capture user’s attention, and offer rhythmic break to the productive experience.

Our [components](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/overview/) have basic motion build in. Use this guidance to customize motion, combine and coordinate motion through out experiences.

## Easing

Strictly linear movement appears unnatural to the human eye. Elements on the screen speed up quickly and slow down smoothly, obeying the physics of a light-weight material. “Easing curves” describe the precise amount of accelerations in motion. We commonly use one of these three types of easing.
