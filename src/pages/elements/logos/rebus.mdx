## IBM Rebus

Designed by Paul Rand for his Eye-Bee-M poster (1981) in support of IBM’s motto, THINK. The Rebus used pictures to represent letters which are an iconic part of IBM’s visual history. Today we still the use the Rebus which has since been adjusted to meet the requirements of differerent mediums, scales and production environments. Like the 8-bar, the Rebus comes in both positive and negative versions. The Rebus can be used in special applications such as merchandise, badges and events but should not be used in place of the 8-Bar as an official brand communications sign off.

## Color

The IBM core colors consisting of the blue and gray families are used when applying color to the Rebus. Always use a minimum of five “steps” away between the foreground and background color to insure appropriate contrast and legibilty.

### Backgrounds for white Rebus

There are many colors backgrounds available to choose from when using the white IBM Rebus. To achieve the best results for legibilty choose from the 60–100 ranges from the IBM color palette. Rememeber to use the negative verion of the Rebus in this case.

### IBM Totem Rebus

The totem rebus adds more meaning to the already lovable original. The totem connects with us because it speaks to the human factor, the user, and the ever evolving relationship of mankind and the machines. It reminds that good design should primarily serve people and move us toward progress.

## Usage

The IBM rebus is a special piece of design and also part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art. The form should not be be altered, adjusted, colored in inapproriate ways. Below are a few samples of things to avoid and a few that are permissable. If these basics are adhered to it should protect the integrity of Paul Rands great design work.
