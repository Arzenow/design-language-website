## Typeface

The IBM Plex™ family comes in sans, serif, condensed and monospaced versions to serve a variety of needs across all experiences. It has been specifically designed to work well in digital environments and small or large scales. It comes in extended Latin and non-Latin scripts. See [Typeface](https://www.ibm.com/elements/typeface/) to learn more.

## Scales

The IBM type scale is built on a single equation. The formula for our scale was created to provide hierarchy for all types of experiences. The formula assumes that y₀=12px:

## Style

Typography creates purposeful texture. It guides users to read and understand the hierarchy of information. The right typographic treatment and the controlled usage of type styles helps manage the display of content, keeping it useful, simple and effective.

### Weights

We suggest to use IBM Plex Light, Regular, and SemiBold for digital experiences. The semibold weight is ideal for section headers, but should not be used for long text.

### Italic

Each weight has an Italic style, which should only be used when you need to emphasize certain words in a sentence (titles of works, technical terms, names of devices, captions).

## Fluid type

To create a better experience along with our fluid grid, fluid type is an option for large display type. We set up our fixed type scales for the breakpoints and have them being fluid in between. This helps us to maintain the quality of typography.

## Type set

Even though IBM Plex contains a wide range of scales, it’s important to use a curated type set. For a clear and focused reading experience, consider content needs and how type works across various screen sizes. The IBM type set includes a Productive set designed primarily for product use and an Expressive set which adds a series scales and fluid behavior.

## Type color

Careful consideration of color maintains quality and recognition for users. Legibility and accessibility are two keys. Keep colored type neutral when in paragraphs. Use primary blue for primary actions.
