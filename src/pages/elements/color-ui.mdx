## Introduction

Application of our color palette brings an unified and recognizable consistency to IBM’s vast array of digital products and interfaces. This consistency is grounded by a set of well-defined rules on how to work with our component library in the context of dark and light themes.

## Color anatomy

The Neutral Gray family is dominant in our UI, making use of subtle shifts in value to help organize content into distinct zones.

The core Blue family has been designated as the primary action color across all products and experiences, ensuring our color aesthetic is a part of every interaction. Additional colors are used sparingly and purposefully.

### Themes

Each theme works with a specific set of primary background colors. These colors are global variables which determine the color of the component being applied within each theme. The light theme uses White and Gray 10 backgrounds and the dark theme uses Gray 100, 90 and 80 backgrounds. Default color tokens are provided for each component based on the primary background color.

### Global background colors

### Light theme

Gray 10 components are generally paired with White backgrounds and White components with Gray 10 backgrounds. Some components, such as buttons and toggles, are common across both backgrounds.

### Dark theme

Gray 90 components are generally paired with Gray 100 backgrounds and Gray 80 components with Gray 90 backgrounds. Some components, such as buttons and toggles, are common across all three dark UI backgrounds.

### High contrast

In some cases, it is helpful to apply light components to dark backgrounds or light components to dark backgrounds. This technique is useful to focus attention or create visual tension when necessary.

## Interaction states

The primary interaction states have been defined for all colors within the palette. For values between Black and 70, interaction gets lighter and for values between 60 and White, interaction gets darker.

#### Hover

A unique set of color tokens are available for hover states. These colors are outside of the core palette and can be considered as half steps in between adjacent colors.

#### Active

The active state is two full steps lighter for values between 100 and 70 and two full steps darker for values between 60 and 10. Exception: White shares the same active state as Gray 10 and Black shares the same active state as Gray 100. Example: the Gray 10 active state is Gray 30.

#### Selected

The selected state is one full step lighter for values between 100 and 70 and one full step darker for values between 60 and 10. Exception: White shares the same selected state as Gray 10 and Black shares the same selected state as Gray 100. Example: the Gray 10 selected state is Gray 20.

#### Focus

The focus state usually appears as a Blue 60 border in the light theme and as a White border in the dark theme.

## Commonly used colors

The table below lists common colors that are not component specific such as primary text, icons and alerts. For a more comprehensive list of values, please refer to the Style section for each individual component.

## Digital accessibility

Using various forms of contrast is the most important consideration when making user-friendly color and interface choices. Awareness of standards and color blindness best practices is the key to accessible color selection.

### WCAG 2.0 Standards

All type color combinations must pass WCAG AA standards of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text. For larger text, if the font weight is light (300) or normal (400) the text should be no smaller than 24px. If the font weight is Semi-Bold (600) then the large text should be no smaller than 19px.

The color families in our palette contain ten values from 10 to 100. White and Black sit outside those values. Black text is WCAG AA accessible on colors ranging from 10 to 50. White text is accessible on colors from 60 to 100.

Beyond black and white, the IBM color palette provides a range of accessible combinations. Subtracting the foreground value from the background value (or vice versa) helps determine whether that color combination meets the WCAG AA contrast ratio success criteria. If the difference between two values is 50 or greater, the colors are accessible. Anything below a difference of 50 may fail accessibility standards.

### Color blindness

The most common form of color blindness is red/green, where sufferers mix up all colors which have red or green as part of the whole color. Our palette and its usage emphasize blues, darks and lights. These concepts ensure a pleasurable and consistent color experience for as many users as possible.

Those affected by Protanopia color blindness are less sensitive to red light, while sufferers of Deuteranopia have the same problem with green. For example, a person with Protanopia will confuse blue and purple because they can’t recognize the red element of the color purple. The third type of color deficiency, Tritanopia, is the least common and refers to sufferers who struggle to distinguish blue or yellow light. The image below shows what the rainbow may look like to individuals with each of these forms of color blindness.
